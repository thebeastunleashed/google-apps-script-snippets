## Open an url in browser

This snippet shows how to open a link using Apps Script in a browser. As a particular example it shows how to get/create a file and open it in browser.
This may not always work as browsers protect tabs from opening spontaneously.

- {{< externalLink >}}
- {{< commentLink >}}
- {{< scrvizLink >}}

{{< codeFromFile "index.js" >}}
{{< codeFromFile "app.html" >}}
{{< codeFromFile "appsscript.json" >}}
